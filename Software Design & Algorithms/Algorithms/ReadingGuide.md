### Stacks & Queues

I've managed to implenent the Stacks & Queues program, using the LinkedList library I wrote earlier. In addition, by making use of unit tests, I've managed to make sure that the program works as intended.

### Memory Manager

Implemented the functions for the memory manager, and even managed to succesfully run the input_simple text file. Still working on input_full.
