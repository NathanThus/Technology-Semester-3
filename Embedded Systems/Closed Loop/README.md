# Closed Loop Systems

## Concept

For this final assignment, the intention is to create a closed loop system using the various principles learned during the semester. The system will be inspired by a demo used by the technology department during one of their presentations, namely a system that uses a Light dependant resistor and servo to optimize lightfall into a solar panel.
